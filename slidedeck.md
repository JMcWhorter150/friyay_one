Interview Process
-

3. In-person Technical Interview (could be multiple)


___
Technical Interview Parts
-
1. Basic knowledge questions
2. Whiteboarding
3. Questions for interviewer

---

What is whiteboarding?
-

___
Whiteboarding
-
It is the process of answering coding related questions without a computer, out loud, while people ask you a ton of questions.

---

Why do they do this?
-

---

Because coding doesn't have a professional certificate, and generally, coders are paid well, so it is a big expense to a company to pay for bad coders. This is a test to weed out bad coders.

---

How do I get good at it?
-

---

PRACTICE!!!
-
That's why we have algorithm/job interview Fridays

---

Problem Solving
-


---

Steps for breaking down a coding problems:

1. Understand the problem
2. Explore concrete examples
3. Break it down
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Look back and refactor

---

Understand the problem
-

Before writing ANY code, you should ask yourself or the interviewer some questions.

---
Understand the problem
-

- Can you restate the question in your own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- What are the outputs of the problem?
- Can the outputs be determined from the input?
- How should I label the pieces of data that are part of the problem?

---
Example
-
Write a program that asks the user for two numerical inputs and adds them together.

---

What questions should you ask?
-

---

Restate Question
-
Implement addition

---

What inputs are going into the problem?
-
- Strings?
- Floats?
- Really, really big numbers?
- Negatives?

---

What should come out of the program?
-
- Integer
- Float
- String?

---

What should I label things?
-
- Naming variables is hard

---

Explore Concrete Examples
-


---
Concrete Examples
-
- Helps you understand the problem better

- Gives you a sanity check to make sure that something isn't too easy or hard in your thinking

---
Concrete Examples
-
- First, start simply. What's the simplest example you can think of?

- Then go on to more complicated examples.

- Then go to edge cases

---
Edge Cases
-

- What if you have empty inputs?
- What if you have invalid inputs?
- What if they try and input code?
- etc.

---
Break Down Problem
-
- These are the steps you write in comments about how you will solve the problem
- Can sometimes get hints from the interviewer
- Also lets you know what parts of the problem you're not confident in
- Should be done prior to writing code

---
Simplify
-
- Find the difficulty of what you're trying to do
- Ignore that difficulty for now
- Write a simple solution
- Then incorporate that problem back in

---
Refactor
-
- Can you check the results?
- Is there duplicated code?
- Does it make sense at a glance?
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?

---

Exercise:
-
- Take a user's input for a number, and then print out all numbers from 1 to that number. For any number divisible by 3, print 'fizz'. For any number divisible by 5, print 'buzz'

---

Exercise 2:
-
- Write a program that asks the user for a numerical input, 'n', and prints out the next 'n' leap years.
